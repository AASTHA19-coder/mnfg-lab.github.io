# Research at MNFG Lab

## Protein Homeostasis & UPS
A major focus of our research is **protein homeostasis in neurons**, particularly the role of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and E3 ubiquitin ligases in identifying and clearing toxic or misfolded proteins.

## Neuroinflammation & Cellular Stress
We investigate how:
- Hypoxic stress  
- Metabolic imbalance  
- Cellular stress pathways  

contribute to neuronal damage and cognitive decline.

## Omics & Functional Genomics
Our lab employs:
- Transcriptomics and proteomics  
- Spatial and integrative omics  
- Systems-level analysis of neurodegeneration  

## AI & Drug Discovery
We apply computational and AI-driven approaches to:
- Identify disease biomarkers  
- Discover novel therapeutic targets  
- Repurpose existing drugs
