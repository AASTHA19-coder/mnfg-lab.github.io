# Current Research Group

## Shefali Kardam
Works on identification of inflammation-associated biomarkers and therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative disorders using integrated transcriptomic and structure-based approaches.

## Shrutikirti Vashishth
Focuses on understanding how gut microbiota influences neurodegeneration and identifying therapeutic targets within the gut–brain axis.

## Apurva
Explores integrative omics in neurodegenerative disorders, with emphasis on spatial transcriptomics and disease pathology.

## Nishita Singh
Uses single-cell and integrative omics to discover clinically actionable molecular signatures for targeted therapy.

## Aastha Kaushik
Investigates dysregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) in neurodegenerative diseases using multi-omics and spatio-temporal analysis.

## Vimarsh Srivastava
Studies cell–cell communication and spatial organization in neurodegenerative disease progression using spatial transcriptomics.
