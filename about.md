# About MNFG Lab

The **Molecular Neuroscience and Functional Genomics (MNFG) Laboratory** at  
**Delhi Technological University (DTU)** is a forward-looking research centre within the Department of Biotechnology.

## Our Vision
We aim to understand how molecular and genetic alterations drive brain disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, and to translate this knowledge into therapeutic strategies.

## Research Approach
MNFG Lab follows a highly interdisciplinary strategy, integrating:
- Molecular biology and cell biology  
- Functional genomics and multi-omics  
- Bioinformatics and artificial intelligence–based drug discovery  

## Disease Focus
- Alzheimer’s disease  
- Parkinson’s disease  
- Huntington’s disease  
- Glioblastoma and aggressive brain cancers  

## Training & Impact
The lab provides strong hands-on training to students and young researchers in modern experimental techniques, data analysis, and translational neuroscience.
